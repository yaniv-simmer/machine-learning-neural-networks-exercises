# Machine Learning Neural Networks Exercises

This project is a Python-based implementation of a neural network model for machine learning exercises. It is designed to be flexible and easy to use, with a focus on understanding and implementing the fundamental concepts of neural networks.
# Features

- Implementation of a neural network model class with customizable parameters.
- Utilizes various activation functions including sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU.
- Includes a data loading and preprocessing module for the MNIST dataset.
- Provides utility functions for forward propagation, backpropagation, and prediction.
- Supports regularization and learning rate adjustments.
- Configured with both PyCharm (.idea directory) and Visual Studio Code (.vscode directory) settings.
# Usage

The main entry point of the application is main.py. This script loads the dataset, defines the neural network parameters, and trains the model.

The neural_network.model class is where the neural network is defined and trained. It includes methods for training the model and predicting labels for input data.
# Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Keras
